re: dropdown menus -  weird that you can click on any of the 3 choices and submit but the url is not affected by what you choose there and nothing happened. In the selection would you have to have an <a href = ""> in there to have the option that you choose mean something?

re: type='checkbox' - check boxes checking more than one output in url and in shotgut seems weird to me. It didn't seem to print out the third choice. Why is this?

How do you change the size of the input box in the first part of a form?

With the checkbox name="option1" or "option2" etc. What is the difference in how it prints in the URL and in shotgun?
With 3 checkboxes and 3 differnet names all 3 show up in shotgun and the URL. With all 3 with the same name all 3 come through in the URL but only 1 comes through in shotgun
